## Common Issues

While working on Open Source projects under the FactSet organization, you may encounter the following common issues.

### Disabling Two Factor Authentication

[According to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/disabling-two-factor-authentication-for-your-personal-account/):

> Warning: If you're a member, billing manager, or outside collaborator to a public repository of an organization that requires two-factor authentication and you disable 2FA, you'll be automatically removed from the organization, and you'll lose your access to their repositories. To regain access to the organization, re-enable two-factor authentication and contact an organization owner.

In the event that you disable, and then re-enable, 2FA, please reach out to a member of the organization to be re-invited.
